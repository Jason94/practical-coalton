;;; Port of Chapter 15 from Practical Common Lisp, by Peter Seibel,
;;; to Coalton.
;;;
;;; In the previous chapter, we took the approach of rewriting the
;;; Common Lisp functions in Coalton. In this chapter, we instead
;;; write a thin wrapper around the Common Lisp functions.
;;;
;;; First, we start by defining a few Coalton types that provide
;;; a type-safe interface to the Common Lisp pathname functions.
;;;
;;; Second, we define a corresponding Coalton function for each
;;; function exported by the Common Lisp pathname package.
